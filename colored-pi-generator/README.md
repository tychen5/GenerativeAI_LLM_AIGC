# A Generative Model for 5D Points

## Project Description
* This repository contains the code and resources for the “Colored Pi Generator” project.
* The goal of this project is to build a generative model that can generate 5-dimensional points, represented as [x, y, r, g, b], from the same distribution as the points in a provided dataset.
* The dataset is derived from an image, where each data point corresponds to a pixel in the image.
* The ‘x’ and ‘y’ values represent the location of the pixel in the image, while ‘r’, ‘g’, and ‘b’ represent the color of the pixel in RGB color space.
* This project demonstrates how to formulate the problem, devise a solution, organize code, and explain the problem and solution. It also includes a demonstration of how the output points come from the same distribution as the input points.
