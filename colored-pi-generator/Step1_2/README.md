# A Generative Model for 5D Points Project
## Step 1, Data Preparation: Load and Preprocess the Data
The first step is to prepare the data. This involves loading the data from the provided sources and preprocessing it to create a suitable dataset for our model.
The data preparation step involves loading the x, y coordinates and the RGB values, combining them into a 5-dimensional dataset to prepare it for training the model.

Provided with the x and y coordinates of the points in numpy arrays. Also have a colored image from which can extract the RGB values of the points. 

To load the data, read the x and y coordinates from the numpy arrays and the RGB values from the colored image. Image pixel coordinates are treated in '(y,x)' order because the first index refers to rows (height) and the second index refers to columns (width). So, the convention may be needed while extracting the RGB values.

Once I have the x, y coordinates and the RGB values, I can combine them into a single array. Each item in this array will be a 5-dimensional vector [x, y, r, g, b], representing a point in the dataset.

## Step 2, Normalize the Data
The second step is to normalize the data. Normalization may be a needed step that may help improve the performance of the model.
The normalization step involves scaling the values in the dataset to a specific range (typically between 0 and 1) or standardizing the distribution of the data. This helps to ensure that the scale or distribution of the data does not negatively impact the learning process of the model.

#### Method 1 (min-max normalization):
Scale the data to a specific range. In this case, normalize the x and y coordinates to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by the size of the image (300, as the image size is 300x300). Similarly, normalize the RGB values to be between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255, as RGB values range from 0 to 255. This method ensures that all values in the dataset are on the same scale, which can help the model to converge faster and lead to better performance.
#### Method 2 (z-score normalization):

Normalize the data to have zero mean and unit variance. This is also a practice when working with neural networks. It involves subtracting the mean of the dataset from each value (to center the data around zero) and then dividing by the standard deviation (to scale the data to unit variance). This method ensures that the distribution of the data is standardized, which may be beneficial when training neural networks.
